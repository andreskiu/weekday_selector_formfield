## [1.0.1] - Octubre 23, 2019.

**Breaking change** The widget is now on a Wrap container, instead of a Container. So, some params doesn't exists anymore and other have been changed (like crossAxisAlignment, now is WrapCrossAlignment)

* [BUG FIX] Selected days were not being passed to "onSave", "onChange" and "Validator" callbacks;

* **New** Now you can customize some extra visuals, like buttons sizes and spacing.
